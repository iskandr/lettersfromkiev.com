These are letters that my great-grandfather Aron wrote to my great-grandmother Manya
in the months before the Nazi invasion of Kiev.
</p>
<p>Manya had evacuated with
my grandfather, who was then six years old, to Ulyanovsk (about a thousand miles away).
Aron had been mobilized into the Soviet army. Aron was captured shortly after the last letter
was written. </p>
<p>After the war, my family learned that all the prisoners were checked for
circumcision and every Jew, including Aron, was immediately executed. These letters
arrived after the war.
