These are letters that my great-grandfather Aron wrote to my great-grandmother Manya
in the weeks before the Nazi invasion of Kiev.</p>
	
<p>
Manya had evacuated with my grandfather Yaakov, who was then seven years old, to Ulyanovsk (about a thousand miles away).
Aron stayed behind in Kiev with his parents (Abram and Leah), sisters-in-law, and young nieces and nephews (ranging from infants to preschoolers). 

</p>

<p>
Aron eventually served in the Civil Defense and was eventually surrounded near city of Zhitomir and was captured by the invading German army shortly after the last letter was written. </p>
	
<p>After the war, my family learned that all the prisoners were checked for
circumcision and every Jew, including Aron, was immediately executed.</p>

<p>
Of the dozen Zakon family who stayed in Kiev only one, Pasha Zakon, survived the German invasion.  Aron's parents (Abram and Leah) along with the wives and children of the other Zakon brothers all went to Babi Yar.
