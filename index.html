These are letters that my great-grandfather Aron wrote to my great-grandmother Manya
in the months before the Nazi invasion of Kiev. Manya had evacuated with
my grandfather, who was then six years old, to Ulyanovsk (about a thousand miles away).
Aron had been mobilized into the Soviet army. Aron was captured shortly after the last letter
was written. After the war, my family learned that all the prisoners were checked for
circumcision and every Jew, including Aron, was immediately executed. These letters
arrived after the war.
