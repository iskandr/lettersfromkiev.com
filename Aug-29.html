Hello dear Musitchka,

Thanks God I am alive and healthy. Musenka, I have send you 3 telegrams and 10 letters and I do not have an answer. I am troubled. Musenka, is that so difficult to write a couple of words? Write how is your health and Yashaâ€™s health,  You are not in good health.
Do not worry and do not think about anything. Buy a warm coat and valenki for Yasha and galoshes for yourself.

Musenka  write me immediately with all the details. Send me a telegram right now.

I  worry a lot. Musenka, it is so painful to not have a single word about you and Yasha.

You make me suffer and think a lot.

Musya kiss Yasha (from me).

Zina and Shura sent you Hello. As soon as you got this letter send me a telegram.


Kisses to everybody. Write your address.

Stay healthy,

Yours truly Aron.
