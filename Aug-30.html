Hi my golden Musitchka and dear son Yashenka.

Musya, I  am offended that you stay silent for such a long time.
I am still in Kiev,  I will see what will happen next.
I have long nights, I do not sleep at all, keep thinking about you, You were sick, and I don't know how you made it to Penza, and now when you got to Ulianovsk that should be impossibly difficult for you. All my telegrams are in Penza.
Musinka, please write to me and say how you settled in your new place.
Please buy a warm coat and valenki for Yasha, - it is so cold where are you now.
I missed you so much and I missed Yasha even more than I missed you.
I have a terrible headache, and I continue to think about you all the time.
Please respond right now.
Hug and kisses.
Greetings to all.
<br/>
Your husband,<br/>

Aron.
