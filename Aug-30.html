Hello my golden Musitchka and dear son Yashenka,<br/><br/>

Musya, I  am offended that you stay silent for such a long time.
I am still in Kiev,  I will see what will happen next.
I have long nights, I do not sleep at all, keep thinking about you, You were sick, and I don't know how you made it to Penza, and now when you got to Ulianovsk that should be impossibly difficult for you. All my telegrams are in Penza.
<br/><br/>
Musinka, please write to me and say how you settled in your new place.
Please buy a warm coat and valenki for Yasha, - it is so cold where are you now.
I missed you so much and I missed Yasha even more than I missed you.
I have a terrible headache, and I continue to think about you all the time.<br/>
Please respond right now.
Hug and kisses.
Greetings to all.
<br/><br/>
Your husband,<br/>

Aron.
